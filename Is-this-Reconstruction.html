                                                       precarious though it seemed. Both humans and animals would dart in and out from the two lower storeys, navigating their way through the still liveable spaces 
                                                       in the building. Six months later, when I returned to the neighbourhood, the house had disappeared into a pile of rubble. Behind this scene of decay, at least four 
                                                       new homes were being built again, some similar to the one I was inhabiting, while others were more frugal versions. Various shades of brick tiles, machine carved 
                                                       timber windows and flat concrete terraces with water-tanks dot the landscape and occasionally, brick and mud walls and tiled sloping rooflines. A neighbour later 
                                                       shared that the household had moved to a smaller home in the vicinity. Since their building had technically not fallen because of the earthquake, the reconstruction
                                                        fund would not be accessible to them.</p>

                                               I peered into the courtyard which had changed since I had last seen it, the house that had been crumbling had collapsed 
                                               into a pile of rubble following the monsoons. The family had moved a few houses away, their future in the neighbourhood less certain than before. 
                                               Other ruins dotted the neighbourhood- homes that had been jolted by the Gorkha Earthquake were still crumbling.</p>
